# App Deployment

In this section lets see what we need to do and how we can deploy all our projects on our kubernetes cluster.

We'll split the workflow on 2 main topics:

1. The preparation on the github repo of the app that we want to deploy -> [Github Workflow](Github%20Workflow.md)
2. The implementation on Argo and the K3S to make it live -> [Argo Workflow](Argo%20Workflow.md)
