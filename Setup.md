# Set Up

To start of we need to physically connect all the accessories mentioned before ([README](README.md)) to our Raspberry Pi 5 ([Raspberry Pi Hardware](Raspberry%20Pi%20Hardware.md))

Once done we can proceed with the software configuration on the Raspberry Pi 5 ([Raspberry Pi Software](Raspberry%20Pi%20Software.md))

Then we should configure all the needed on our internet router ([Router Configuration](Router%20Configuration.md))

And lastly we can create and set up the DNS ([DNS Configuration](DNS%20Configuration.md))
