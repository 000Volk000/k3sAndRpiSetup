## Active Cooler
We need to put the active cooler with the thermal pads on the 3 heat points like in this photo

Once put, you need to press the 2 white spring-loaded pins that are situated on the corner of the Raspberry and that if you positioned the active cooler right, it should be right above a holes on the Raspberry Pi designed to clamp in place the cooler.

Press the springs until it gets to the other side, like this

Lastly, we'll connect the PWM fan cable onto the corresponding place.

To do that we need to remove the plastic cover that is situated on the top-right side of the Raspberry Pi and connect there the connector, it should be like this
